##Registered savings vehicles

![van](van.jpg)

???
By providing registered savings vehicles (or accounts).

---
class: middle

##Registered savings vehicle
An account through a financial institution that is registered with the federal
government that allows you to avoid some taxes, or pay them later.

???
An account (or multiple accounts) through a financial institution (eg bank, stock brokerage)
that is registered with the federal government that allows you to defer or avoid some taxes.

class: middle
##There are four types of savings vehicles
* RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan)
* RESP (Registered Education Savings Plan)
* RDSP (Registered Disability Savings Plan)
* TFSA (Tax Free Savings Account)

???
There are four types of savings vehicles: RRSP, RESP, RDSP and to mess up the naming scheme, the relatively new TFSA

---
class: center, middle
###All four types allow you to avoid paying capital gains tax on any investments made inside of them

???
I'll return to this point shortly.

class: middle
##RESP (Registered Education Savings Plan)
Intent: saving money for a child for education.

Contribution room: $50,000 per child.
???
I'll quickly cover the easiest to understand, the RESP.

---
class: middle

##Free money
Paired with the Canada Education Savings Grant, pays 20 cents on the dollar directly
from the government, to a maximum of $500 per year and $7200 per child.

???
This is the only one that provides free money from the government, via the Canada Education Savings Grant
witch matches 20% of your contribution up to $7200 per child.

---
class: middle
##RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan)
Intent: Saving money for retirement.

Contribution room: 18% of your earned income from the previous year, max ~$25,000/year

---
class: middle
You don't pay taxes on money in an RRSP until you withdraw it.

eg. If you make $50,000, and put $5000 in an RRSP, you pay income tax as though
you only made $45,000.

???

You can either claim that five grand when you do your taxes and get refunded about $1500

or you can pre-emptively pay less taxes all year by specifying so on your T1213, which is that
form Hany gives you every year.

---
class: middle
###You can withdraw RRSP money at any time. When you do:

* It counts as income for the year, and you pay income tax on it
* You lose that contribution room forever*

???

You can withdraw RRSP money at any time. When you do:

It counts as income for the year, and you pay income tax on it
Bye bye refund

You lose that contribution room forever, unless you're buying a home or going back
to school, allowing $25000 and $20000 respectively.

---
class: middle

##TFSA (Tax Free Savings Account)
Intent: Saving money for everything else.

Contribution room: Currently $41,000 total, with $10,000 more per year.

???

New car, renovations, start a business, take a family vacation.

---
class: middle
You *do* pay taxes on TFSA contributions.

eg. If you make $50,000, and put $5000 in an TFSA, you pay income tax on the full $50,000

???

You will get no refund

---
class: middle

###You can withdraw TFSA money at any time. When you do:

* You lose that contribution room until the following year
* Since you already paid the taxes on it, you can withdraw it tax-free

---
class: middle

##So, TFSA or RRSP?

![what](what.jpg)

---
class: middle

###It doesn't matter

Retired people tend to live on a lower income, and that makes RRSPs more
appealing because lower income means lower taxes.

TFSAs are more versatile for short term saving and spending.

???
All things being equal, putting your money in TFSAs vs RRSPs will not affect
how much you pay in taxes- only when.

---

#Who cares?

![what](what.jpg)

???

Now or later, I have to pay the taxes, so why not just stuff my money in my
TD account?

#Remember
###All four types allow you to avoid paying capital gains tax on any investments made inside of them

???
So let's talk about investments, starting with the simplest kind.

---
class: center, middle

#TFSA/RRSP Saving accounts
Aside from the tax benefits, these are usually identical to normal savings accounts.

Most banks only offer ~1.0% annual interest...

???

Every bank in the country offers TSFA/RRSP savings accounts.
Aside from the tax benefits, these are usually identical to normal savings accounts.

Often labeled "high-interest", but currently all major banks only offer ~1.0%
annual interest...

---
class: center, middle

... which is less than inflation.

![deflate](deflate.png)

???

That means the money you have sitting in your savings account can buy less things
the longer it sits there.

---
class: center, middle

###TFSA/RRSPs can also be: stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs.

###You can have multiple TFSA/RRSP accounts.

???
Despite the name, Tax Free Savings Accounts do not have to be savings accounts.
You can get TFSA accounts for more exciting things: stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs.

You can also have any number of TFSAs, as long as the total contribution room is
not exceeded.

---
#Stocks and bonds

##Stocks (aka equity)
A share in the ownership of a company. Gains value with company growth. Average return: 8.5%

##Bond
A loan, often to the government or trusted business, with a pre-set interest rate. Average return: 4.5%

???

As you can see, these rates are much higher than the 1.0% from a savings account. However...

---
##The stock market is volatile

Investments are always risk/reward. The biggest returns come with the biggest risk.

In the short term, the stock market can vary wildly, especially in the event of a crash, ie 2008

???
Even if you believe in the long term stability of the stock market, you have to be prepared to deal with
major swings, which makes it a dangerous choice for short term savings.

---
##Bonds mitigate volatility

Bonds tend to move inversely with stocks.

Investing in both can make stock market swings less impactful.

???
General investment advice is to hold roughly your age in bonds, and the rest in stocks.

---
#How to invest
Get an account at a brokerage, and start buying individual stocks.

Riskiest option. This is basically gambling.

???
Get an account at a brokerage, such as iTRADE or Questrade and start buying stocks
you think will perform well.

Riskiest option. Most people lose money this way, and the minority that don't
often credit themselves too much for the success.

---
##Mutual Funds
You trust your money to a pool handled by a financial expert.

Less risky, but most mutual funds do also fail in the long term.

Mutual funds make their money from fees.

???
You trust your money to a pool handled by a financial expert, such as a bank, and they invest it in stocks/bonds.

In theory, less risky, but most mutual funds do also fail in the long term.

Mutual funds make their money from fees, so you lose those fees regardless of performance.

---
##Index Funds and ETFs
A type of mutual fund that attempts to reflect the stock market as a whole.

Less risky again, as any particular company or industry crashing doesn't affect it much.

Lower fees because much of it can be automated.

???
A type of mutual fund that attempts to reflect the stock market as a whole, or a subset of the stock market.

Less risky again, as any particular company or industry crashing doesn't affect it much. As long as the stock market
as a whole goes up, so do index funds.

Lower fees because much of it can be automated.
